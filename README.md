<td><h5><a href="https://gcconnex.gc.ca/newsfeed">Go to your newsfeed!</a></h5></td>        
<td><h5>This page lets you see what is happening on GCconnex. It lets you see the most recent activities, posts, and discussions from your colleagues or groups you've joined.</h5></td>        
<td><h5>You can't add or write anything here - however you will find links to active discussions or blogs and can join those conversations. </h5></td>      
<tr><td><h5>I want to write a little something about what I'm currently doing or share a great link I've found.</a></h5></td>        
<td><h5><a href="https://gcconnex.gc.ca/thewire/all">Go to The Wire!</h5></td>        
<td><h5>This page is like Twitter. You can tell others what you're doing, share a great link or resource, ask a question so all GCConnex members can see it (and hopefully help you answer it!). Don't forget - others can comment!</h5></td>        
<td><h5>There is a 140 character limit and colleagues can comment; so try not to be too controversial!</h5></td>

<tr><td><h5>I want to write a regular update to my followers and colleagues about what I'm doing or interested in!<a></h5></td>

<td><h5><a href="https://gcconnex.gc.ca/polls">Go to Polls by clicking on the More tab!</a></h5></td>

<tr> <td><h5>I want to chat instantly with colleagues that are currently online.</h5></td> 
<td><h5>There is a chat option at the bottom, right hand corner of your GCconnex screen!</h5></td> 
<td><h5>This option allows you to chat "live" with your colleagues whom are already on GCconnex, remember if a decision is made - you may want to save the conversation by copying and pasting it into a word document.</h5></td>
<td><h5>GCconnex does not track and save live chats.  You must copy the chat text and save it yourself.</h5></td>
